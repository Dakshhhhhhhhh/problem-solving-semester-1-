1. Initialize Global Variables: Set transaction_id = 1, create empty transactions list, and define categories list
2. Load Existing Data: Attempt to read from "money_data.txt" file and populate transactions list
3. Main Program Loop: Continuously display menu and process user choices until exit
4. Menu Options: 
   - Add new financial transactions (income/expense)
   - View all recorded transactions  
   - Modify existing transaction details
   - Remove transactions from records
   - Display financial summary (totals, balance, savings rate)
   - Show category-wise spending breakdown
   - Search transactions by category or date
   - Exit program with data saving

Storage Format: Each transaction stored as tuple (ID, Type, Amount, Category, Description, Date)
Data Persistence: Automatic loading on startup and saving on exit to text file
ID System: Sequential numbering with renumbering after deletions

Type Selection: User chooses between Income (money in) or Expense (money out)
Amount Validation: Character-by-character numeric check with positive value verification
Category Selection: Predefined categories mapped through if-elif chains
Optional Updates: Blank inputs preserve existing values during modifications

Income/Expense Tracking: Separate accumulation of all income and expense transactions
Balance Computation: Net balance = Total Income - Total Expenses
Savings Rate: (Net Balance / Total Income) × 100 when income > 0
Category Analysis: Individual category totals and percentage contributions

Transaction Listing: Formatted tabular display of all transactions
Category Filtering: Display transactions belonging to specific categories
Date Filtering: Show transactions occurring on specified dates
Financial Reporting: Summary totals with spending status indicators

1. Creation: User provides type, amount, category, description, date → assigned sequential ID
2. Storage: Added to global list and eventually persisted to file
3. Modification: Locate by ID → validate new inputs → update tuple in list
4. Deletion: Locate by ID → confirm → remove → renumber all remaining IDs
5. Retrieval: Iterate through list with various filtering options

Numeric Checks: Character-by-character examination of amount strings
Range Validation: Ensure positive amounts and valid menu choices
Category Mapping: If-elif chains to convert numbers to category names
Empty Input Handling: Preserve existing values when inputs are blank
User Input → Validation → Processing → Storage → Display → File Persistence
